### Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quantum link model

Yao-Tai	Kang

We study the driven critical dynamics of the quantum link model, whose Hamiltonian describes the one-dimensional $$U(1)$$ lattice gauge theory. We find that combined topological defects emerge after the quench and they consist of both gauge field and matter field excitations. Furthermore, the ratio of gauge field and matter field excitation is 1/2 due to the constraint of the Gauss' law. We show that the scaling of these combined topological defects satisfies the usual Kibble-Zurek mechanism. We verify that both the electric flux and the entanglement entropy satisfy the finite-time scaling theory in the whole driven process. Possible experimental realizations are discussed.

### Tensor network renormalization study on boundary CFT underlying classical spin models

Shumpei	Iino

Tensor network renormalization (TNR) [1] is one of the most efficient tensor renormalization group [2] algorithms,  which is able to eliminate the short correlated loop and yield the correct fixed point tensor even at criticality. We implement the extended TNR algorithm so as to be applicable for the system with open boundaries, and investigate the surface critical behavior and the emergent conformal invariance.  We successfully compute the boundary conformal spectrum for various classical spin models on a lattice, all of which are completely consistent with the results from the underlying boundary CFT [3].

### Phase diagram of the SU(2)xSU(2)-invariant Penson-Kolb-Hubbard model

Roman	Rausch

Using the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) technique, we investigate the Hubbard model with a nearest-neighbor density-density (extended) term as well as a pair-hopping (Penson-Kolb) term $$V$$; at a point where the charge-SU(2) pseudospin symmetry is preserved. Strong positive $$V$$ leads to a phase where s-wave superconductivity is mixed with a charge-density wave (CDW), while strong negative $$V$$ leads to a phase where $$\eta$$-wave superconductivity is mixed with phase separation (PS). It is shown that there are also two intervening phases: For negative $$V$$, we find an intervening partially polarized pseudospin-ferromagnet. For positive $$V$$, there is a dimerized bond order wave phase (BOW) which is much broader and extends to much larger interactions than in the charge-SU(2) broken extended Hubbard model. Apart from standard techniques, we also apply machine learning to confirm its phase boundaries.

### Self-learning Monte Carlo simulation in the semiclassical site-diluted double-exchange model

Hidehiko	Kohshiro

The self-learning Monte Carlo (SLMC) method is a speed-up algorithm for Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation which employs an effective model trained to generate a Boltzmann weight similar to one of the original model[1]. SLMC method has not been applied to inhomogeneous systems. We applied SLMC method to the site-diluted the semiclassical double exchange model, where itinerant many-body electron system coupled to localized classical spins to investigate the efficiency of SLMC for disordered systems[3]. As a result of training, we observed RKKY-like exchange coupling, which oscillates with a distance between localized spins consistent with previous work [2].

### Numerical strong-disorder renormalization group for two-dimensional random quantum spin systems

Kouichi	Seki

Recently, two-dimensional (2D) frustrated quantum spin systems with random interactions attract much interest, where the randomness and frustration effects may cooperatively induce exotic spin-liquid-like behaviors[1]. However, the exact diagonalization (ED) results in the previous studies are not sufficient to conclude precise properties of such exotic behaviors. The main purpose of our study is to develop a numerical renormalization group approach that efficiently works for the 2D random quantum spin systems, on the basis of the strong-disorder renormalization groups (SDRGs)[2,3], which actually succeeded in extracting the random singlet ground state of 1D random quantum spin systems. We reformulate an SDRG algorithm for 2D random quantum spin systems and then evaluate its numerical accuracy with precise comparisons with ED results up to 24 spins. We then find that that the numerical accuracy is significantly affected by definitions of energy scale cutoffs used in renormalizing two block spins. In our presentation, we explain the physical roles of the energy scale cutoffs and then present benchmark results of our numerical SDRG for S = 1/2 triangular lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnets with box-type random exchange couplings.
