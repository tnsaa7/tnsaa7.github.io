Our research interests involve strongly-correlated many-body systems,
with a focus on emergent phenomena, exotic phases, and
phase transitions.

We aim to understand the physics of materials through microscopic models using
computational methods as our major theoretical tools.   
Our work has employed Monte Carlo simulations, and Tensor Network related methods to explore the  physics of classical and quantum magnetic materials, cold atoms in optical lattices, bosonic fluids and low-dimensional systems.

 We are also interested in working at the interface of physics and computer science to develop efficient algorithms for simulating quantum mechanical  systems on classical computers,  including  tensor network algorithms, machine learning, and how the ideas from physics can be applied in computer science.
